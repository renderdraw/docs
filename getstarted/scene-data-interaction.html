<h1>3D Scene Data Interaction</h1>
<p>Methods on our components are asynchronous and event-based. This means method calls cannot be expected to return data directly, instead we query the active scene and raise an event based on the current scene asynchronously.</p>
<p>For example, a common workflow is to set up a scene with the ability to move a camera to focus on a particular component or point in space based on some interaction within Salesforce (most likely configuration, but we'll leave this up to you to decide).&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>How do you know where to move the camera?</li>
  <li>What 3D nodes exist within the model you have linked and are viewing?</li>
  <li>Where is the camera currently?</li>
</ul>
<p>We have setup functions on our AdvancedRenderer component to retrieve this information, to then use it in future functional calls, but in order to maintain our unidirectional dataflow, we reply using events.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A data retrieving function will raise an event on successful calling, let's take a look at an example from the list above.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/renderdraw/6f5cfd6c246d8adb239429204ed09768">link to the source gist</a></p>
<p>Calling the function is simple, find the instance of your AdvancedRenderer on your component, and call the function (<a href="/components/AdvancedRenderer">full API is available here).</a></p>
<p>in order to retrieve the response, you must register a handler on your component, and then setup the action as a response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The end result is a unidirectional data flow where a call is made into an instance of our AdvancedRenderer and the output is the JSON Structure of the 3D model you linked to, ex:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this response, you then can focus on a particular node based on its id, name or uniqueId (all provided within the event raised).&nbsp;</p>
