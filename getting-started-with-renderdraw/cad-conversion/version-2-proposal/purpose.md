**Purpose**

The CAD Conversion API is a powerful, versatile tool designed to streamline the process of converting CAD files into various formats, suitable for a wide range of applications. It is specifically tailored to meet the needs of professionals in engineering, architecture, manufacturing, and design, who require efficient and reliable conversion of CAD drawings and models.

**Key Features**

1. **Versatile File Support**: Accepts a wide range of CAD file formats, both in binary and Zip file formats, containing assemblies, parts, or subassemblies.
2. **Multiple Dimension Types**: Catering to both 3D and 2D CAD files, the API provides flexibility for different types of projects and design needs.
3. **Customizable Output Formats**: Primarily converts files to GLB format, with the capability to support various other formats as per user requirements.
4. **Screenshot Capability**: This offers an option to capture and return a 2D screenshot of the CAD model, enhancing the visualization and presentation of the design.
5. **Assembly Mode Options**: Users can select from full assembly, subassemblies only, or a unified model, providing control over the level of detail in the output.
6. **Adjustable Compression**: Features compression level settings to balance between file size and quality, optimizing for both storage and performance.
7. **Comprehensive Output**: Besides the converted model, the API provides a detailed JSON structure of the CAD model, including Product Manufacturing Information (PMI), for in-depth analysis and use.

**Benefits**

1. **Efficiency**: Automates the conversion process, saving time and resources that would otherwise be spent on manual conversion.
2. **Accuracy**: Maintains high fidelity in conversions, ensuring that the integrity of the original design is preserved.
3. **Flexibility**: The API's range of options and settings allows it to be tailored to specific project requirements, making it highly adaptable.
4. **Ease of Integration**: Designed to seamlessly integrate with existing systems and workflows, facilitating a smooth implementation in various environments.
5. **Accessibility**: By providing direct access to converted files and assembly information, the API enhances the accessibility and usability of CAD data.
6. **Scalability**: Capable of handling both small and large-scale conversion needs, making it suitable for individual professionals as well as large enterprises.

This CAD Conversion API stands as a crucial tool for anyone needing to convert and manipulate CAD files efficiently. Its combination of versatility, accuracy, and user-friendly features make it an invaluable asset in the realm of CAD file management and utilization.
