# Interacting with RenderDraw using Lightning Messaging Service (LMS)

RenderDraw revolutionizes the way enterprises visualize and interact with 2D and 3D models directly within Salesforce, leveraging the power of Lightning Messaging Service (LMS) to create a seamless, interactive experience. LMS enables RenderDraw to communicate efficiently across components, applications, and the Salesforce ecosystem, ensuring real-time responsiveness and enhanced user engagement.

With RenderDraw, users can effortlessly navigate through complex layouts, configure products in 3D, visualize digital twins, and access step-by-step field service guides. The integration with LMS facilitates a dynamic interaction model where users can:

* **Hover over elements** within the canvas to receive instant feedback or detailed information, enhancing the understanding and interaction with 2D floorplans or 3D models.
* **Select elements** within the canvas, triggering actions such as configuration options, additional product information, or detailed part data, bridging the gap between visualization and action.
* **Initialize the canvas** with specific settings and contexts, preparing the environment for tailored user experiences right from the start.
* **Engage in diverse interactions** within the canvas, from simple clicks to complex gestures, allowing for a wide range of activities that cater to various use cases, including product customization and exploration.
* **Select records** associated with canvas elements, enabling a seamless integration between visual elements and Salesforce records, which is critical for applications like digital twins and service guides.

RenderDraw's use of LMS underscores a commitment to providing a robust, scalable solution for complex visualizations and interactions within Salesforce. By leveraging LMS, RenderDraw ensures a high level of interoperability and user experience, making complex data and configurations accessible and actionable for users across the enterprise.

This documentation aims to guide developers and administrators through the intricacies of interacting with RenderDraw using LMS, encompassing the setup, usage, and best practices to fully exploit the potential of RenderDraw in enhancing enterprise visualizations and user interactions.
