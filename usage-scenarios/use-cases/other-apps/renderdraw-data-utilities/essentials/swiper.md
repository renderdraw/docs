# Swiper

Let's dive into another fantastic feature of our Salesforce system. This time, we'll explore a fun and dynamic component - the "Swiper"!

Welcome to your interactive slide deck powered by Swiper, a modern mobile touch slider. Imagine being able to dynamically organize your content, whether it's images, text, or a mix of both, into an engaging, interactive slideshow. That's what Swiper is all about!

As an admin, you're the master of this slide universe. At the top of the component, you'll find two magical buttons: the Settings and Refresh icons. The Refresh button is your instant do-over; click it and your slide deck will refresh, showcasing the most recent updates.

Feeling creative? Click on the Settings button and behold the power to tweak the Swiper to your heart's content! A dialog box with two main sections - "File Setting" and "Swiper Setting" - will open. This is where you truly get to shape your slide experience.

In the "File Setting" tab, you can add or delete external links to enrich your slide content. You can drag-and-drop to rearrange these links as you see fit - it's as easy as organizing your desktop icons! Each link has its own image URL, title, and description fields, and you can update any of these by just clicking and typing.

Now let's move to the "Swiper Setting" tab. Here, you'll find a number of options to customize the behavior and appearance of your slide deck. You can choose to enable navigation arrows, loop slides for an endless slideshow, and even enable a gallery for thumbnails. Want to customize the pagination style or slide transition effect? No problem. You can easily choose from a list of options for each.

Once you're happy with your settings, click the Save button. Or if you have second thoughts about any changes, just hit Cancel, and everything will revert back to its previous state.

Beneath the buttons, you'll find an iframe, your stage for displaying the Swiper. This is where your slide deck comes alive!

In essence, the Swiper is your dynamic slide show tool for Salesforce. It's perfect for showcasing product photos, marketing materials, training content, or anything else you can dream up. Make your content interactive, make it fun, and make it Swiper!
