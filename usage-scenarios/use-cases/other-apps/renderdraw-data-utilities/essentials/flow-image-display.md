# Flow Image display

Roll out the red carpet for the "Flow Image Display" component, the glamorous superstar of Salesforce Lightning Flow screens!

This component isn't your typical plain-jane text box or a humble drop-down list. It's the life of the party, bringing a splash of color, creativity, and visual appeal to your flow screens. And the best part? You can be the director of this show!

Want to place a cheery welcome image at the start of your flow, or a 'congratulations' GIF at the end? You can do it all with this component.

Think of the `url` property as your magic ticket. Just plug in the web address of your favorite image, and voila - it's up on the big screen!

The `imageAlignment` property is like your stage director. You can ask it to shift your image to the left, center, or right, wherever you feel it fits the best. The spotlight follows your command!

The `width` and `height` properties are your costume department, helping your image look its best. You set the size, and it ensures your image fits right into it.

In the world of Salesforce Lightning Flows, where data and processes rule the roost, our Flow Image Display component is a refreshing change, bringing a touch of glamour and vibrancy. So, let your creativity flow and add a whole new level of engagement to your flows with this component!
