# Advanced

Our Advanced Data Utilities are designed to offer a variety of sophisticated functionalities that can drastically enhance your experience with Salesforce. These utilities include advanced PDF parsing, annotation capabilities, and CSV importing tools.

#### PDF Parser

The PDF Parser utility provides the ability to parse PDF files directly within Salesforce. This feature allows you to extract elements such as images, text, or data tables from the PDFs. Once extracted, these elements can be related to Salesforce files attached to Salesforce records. Additionally, this feature offers the capability to automatically create these relations, streamlining the process and saving valuable time.

#### AnnotateIt! PDFs

With AnnotateIt! PDFs, users can annotate PDF documents directly within Salesforce. This feature adds another layer of interactivity and collaboration to your Salesforce experience, enabling users to highlight, add comments, or mark up PDFs without leaving the platform.

#### CSV Importer

The CSV Importer tool simplifies the process of importing data into Salesforce from CSV files. This utility is designed to ensure seamless data integration, minimizing the hassle of manually entering or transferring data from other sources.

The Advanced Data Utilities aim to expand on Salesforce's existing features, providing users a more efficient and interactive experience. These utilities can be easily added to your Salesforce instance using the Lightning App Builder.
