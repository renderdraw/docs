# 360º Virtual Tours

Imagine this: You're an admin of a real estate company, and you're sitting in your office chair with a fresh cup of coffee. Instead of going through the logistics of organizing property tours, you have the power to create immersive 3D walkthroughs right at your fingertips! That's where this marvelous 360-degree virtual tour Lightning Web Component (LWC) comes into play!

Harnessing the magic of equirectangular photos (a fancy term for 360-degree panoramic photos), this LWC lets you stitch together photos into an interactive 3D experience. No more static photos - you can give your clients a complete virtual experience of walking through the property from the comfort of their homes!

The component comes packed with an intuitive interface. As an admin, you'll see a list of available scenes, each a different room or part of the property. Like a movie director, you can decide what scenes to show and when. Switch between the scenes, rename them, or hide the scene menu with a few simple clicks. Want to check how your tour looks? Just hit the "Viewing" button. Need to make some changes? Switch to "Editing" mode as easily as flipping a switch!

And the cherry on top? If you're an admin, you'll also get an extra badge showing the number of hotspots in each scene. It's like a mini scoreboard for you to keep track of all the interesting points in each scene!

With the 3D walkthrough ready, the possibilities are endless. Clients can explore the property at their own pace, real estate agents can showcase properties more effectively, and you? Well, you get to sip that coffee knowing you've made property tours an absolute breeze!

So why wait? It's time to revolutionize the way property tours are done in Salesforce!

* Be informed with a default image and message if the tour isn't enabled or there are no images available.

As an admin, you have the additional ability to:

* Switch between viewing and editing modes.
* Publish the virtual tour.
* Adjust the name of the scenes.
* Choose to show or hide the scene menu.
* Add the first image to create a tour if no images are available.
