## Automated Layout Area Detection using OCR

The Optical Character Recognition (OCR) feature in our application allows administrators to automatically detect and create layout areas on a 2D canvas based on the text content of the background image. This powerful capability eliminates the need for manual drawing and significantly reduces the time and effort required to define layout areas.

### Benefits

* **Saves Hundreds of Hours**: By automating the process of detecting and creating layout areas, administrators can save a substantial amount of time compared to manually drawing each area. This efficiency gain is particularly valuable when dealing with complex layouts or a large number of images.
* **Increased Accuracy**: The OCR technology accurately identifies the text elements on the image and creates precise layout areas around them. This reduces the chances of human error and ensures consistent results across multiple images.
* **Enhanced Productivity**: With the automated OCR process, administrators can quickly process a batch of images and generate layout areas in a matter of minutes. This enables them to focus on other important tasks and streamlines the overall workflow.

### How to Use

1. **Navigate to the 2D Canvas**: Open the desired 2D canvas that contains the background image you want to process.
2. **Access the Layout Menu**: Click on the "Layout" option in the top menu to access the layout-related features.
3. **Initiate OCR Process**: From the layout menu, select "Add via OCR" to start the automated layout area detection process.
4. **Process OCR**: Click on the "Process OCR" button to begin analyzing the background image and extracting the text elements.
5. **Review and Confirm**: Once the OCR process is complete, review the detected layout areas. You can update the names of the areas if needed, hover over each row to see the corresponding area on the canvas, and remove any unwanted areas. When you are satisfied with the results, click on "Finish" to add the layout areas to the canvas.
6. **Close the Menu**: After adding the layout areas, click on the "Close" button to exit the layout menu.
7. **Link Areas to Records (Optional)**: If desired, you can establish relationships between the layout areas and specific records. Click on the "Areas" option and select an area. Search for the desired record by object and record name. The available objects can be set globally through the scene's environment settings under "Default related objects".
8. **Repeat as Needed**: Repeat the process for other layout areas or images as required.

By following these steps, administrators can harness the power of OCR to automatically detect and create layout areas on their 2D canvases. This feature significantly reduces the manual effort involved and enables efficient processing of multiple images.

### Conclusion

The automated layout area detection using OCR is a game-changer for administrators working with 2D canvases. By eliminating the need for manual drawing and leveraging accurate text recognition, this feature saves countless hours and enhances productivity. Embrace this powerful capability to streamline your workflow and unlock new possibilities in your application.
