#### 1. Go to a page where the RenderDraw 2D Scene Director has been Added

You will see this screen and action if your Metadata settings are set up for the record type. If not, view the section on Metadata setup within the documentation portal to add a field and relationship where we can store your settings.

#### 3. Once setup, your screen should look like this, you are now ready to setup the scene.

If the 2D Canvas component is passed this record id, these scene settings will load automatically. Setup the scene with Droppable Areas, Draggable Items and DropZones, Layout Elements for retail or layouts, or selectable shapes for visualization
