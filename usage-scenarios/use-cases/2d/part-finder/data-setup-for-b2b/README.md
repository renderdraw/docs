# Data Setup for B2B

### There is a one-time, multi-step process to complete Setup once you have RenderDraw installed and&#x20;

### Setup Fields & Metadata

In order to get started we need to setup Relationships to our chosen objects. This is the same process for 2D and 3D, so following the guide at Relationships is fine.

[relationships](../../../../../diving-deeper/relationships/ "mention")

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure you populate the 2D Scene settings field in the metadata relationship&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Create Custom Permission Sets

Extend the RenderDraw User Permission set to include the following

&#x20;

### Add 2D Scene Editor to Chosen Catalog Page to edit the documents



### Create a containing Flow for the Product Catalog itself



### Add the Flow for the Product Catalog Detail page through the experience builder
