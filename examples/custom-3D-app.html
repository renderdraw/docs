<h1>Custom 3D App Development using Salesforce</h1>
<h3>Interacting with our components</h3>
<p>Currently, we support Aura interactions, and our components can be wrapped and utilized directly due to their (ever growing) APIs through both attributes, events as well as method. We follow a unidirectional data flow pattern by enabling our rendering components to respond to events, functions and attribute changes, then raising events to respond if data is to be returned. To respond, simply register a handler for that given event type. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Branding</h2>
<h3>Branding with Static Resources</h3>
<p>Our image attributes (loadingImage, the imageURL parameter in the displayMedia method and the brandImageURL) all utilize the direct path to the image in order to render to your screen. If your org has access to the URL you supply for these parameters, your images will display properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often times, security is locked down within your org, causing images not to display whenever they are used from outside servers. To get around this, we can use Static Resources as the values for the url like this:&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/testcustomrenderdrawdev_cmp_â€”_renderdraw.png"></figure>
<p>This value represents an image we uploaded to a Static Resource, by name like this:</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/static_resources___salesforce.png"></figure>
