# Setup a background
When looking At a product in real life things tend to not float in front of a solid color background. With that in mind we've decided to provide two different methods to give your seems a bit of dimension. The first is providing a static photo as a background, and the second is providing What we consider a photo dome.

## Photo Background
The photo background is exactly what it sounds like a photograph to use his background instead of the static color that we provide. To provide a new photo for your background you must first host a photo somewhere that is probably accessible from your salesforce instance.
