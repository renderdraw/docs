# RenderDraw Philosophy

## Background

RenderDraw was created because a native solution didn't exist to serve the growing trend of using interactive 2D & 3D in business and manufacturing. Our founders have backgrounds in manufacturing, and understand that there is more to 3D than attempting to sell something shiny (although shiny is nice, and definitely helps sales).

#### **Our philosophy is simple**.&#x20;

Using 2D & 3D interaction, we can improve every sales and service scenario for every employee and customer within the manufacturing industry.&#x20;

#### **Looking to empower your service team with product visuals for more accurate customer service?**&#x20;

Explode a diagram, view related documents, or get some perspective by slicing it in half. &#x20;

#### **Looking to increase conversions of sales for your products?**

Add a fully interactive 3D scene to your B2B commerce or Community to let users/customers see what they are configuring before they buy. _Offering a visual guided-selling expereince can increase conversions by roughly 42%._

#### **Looking to scale self-serve for customers through Communities?**&#x20;

Securley display 3D diagrams, allowing for native user interaction and triggering of processes, within Salesforce, based on those interactions.&#x20;

**Our goal is to deliver world class tools that provide the best 2D and 3D experience, all directly within Salesforce.**

## Design&#x20;

RenderDraw was designed and created with Salesforce scale in mind. By utilizing our 3D relationship management system, _we provide a framework to relate and use your 3D models at scale._&#x20;

With flexibility in mind we allow your Admin to fully customize how your products are shown in 3D with clicks not code. _Creating a low lift implementation and scaleable maintenance._&#x20;
